# Shortener link project
Link shortener is a project that will generate more concise links when users want to use a URL so that when users want to send a link or insert a link to a place it becomes more concise.

This project itself was created using express js and typescript and deployment using docker for server testing, and for ui deployment I use vercel, for server deployment I use digitalOcean.
